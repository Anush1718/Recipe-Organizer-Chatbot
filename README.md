# Recipe-Organizer-Chatbot
Recipe Organizer Chatbot is a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to interact with a ChatGPT-like interface to discover recipes based on ingredients they have. This project leverages OpenAI's language model and the Spoonacular API to provide detailed recipe instructions, including used and missed ingredients.
